# oldWorldsDemise

Old World's Demise is a project created by Tor, aka Tigerbatking.

This project is being made open source, so that people can help with editing or working on the project, to either ensure histioricity, or make the project more fun and completed.

Extract this file:
\tors_owd\gfx\map\terrain\flatmap.zip
This allows for the ability to zoom out and have the paper map effect of CK3.

When creating appropriate files, such as for character history or Dynasties. Please ensure that if you want your project to be merged into main, you do the following:
Increase the left most digit by 1, from whatever is the highest relevant digit.
As an example, domain: 0x includes files with the structure of owd_00, up to owd_09 (Domains 0000-9999).
Domain 1x would be owd_10, up to owd_19 (Domains 10000-10999)
Domain 10x would be owd_100 up to owd_109 (Domains 100000-10999)
etc.
Do not however use any Domains in the 0x for any project, as this falls into Tor's Main branch of categories, and act as the most default branch.

Domains:
0     = Tor
1-9   = [Open]
10>   = [Open], but use up all other open domains first.
