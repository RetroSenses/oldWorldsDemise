 ranger:0 "Rangers"
 ranger_flavor:0 "#F By the time of the American Revolution, there were several Ranger companies in action against the British, who complained mightily about the methods these colonials used – ambushes, raids, demolitions, sniping, and the like.

 line_infantry:0 "Line Infantry"
 line_infantry_flavor:0 "#F The Roman legion was famous for its rigid discipline – moving in tight formation, infantry continuously cycled fresh soldiers to the front of the line, massacring tougher but less-disciplined Gaulish and German soldiers. A similar concept exists in the line infantry.#!"

 horseman:0 "Horsemen"

 courser:0 "Coursers"
 courser_flavor:0 "#F At various points in history, different cultures have found a need for a cavalry that was lighter than the fully-armored knight.

 cavalry_flavor:0 "#F Technically, any unit that fought from horseback (or these days motorized or even helicopter transport) – archers, knights, lancers, dragoons, hussars, uhlans, cossacks, cuirassiers, etc. – is considered “cavalry.” But when the common sort think of the term, they envision sabre- and rifle-armed bravadoes mounted on magnificent steeds.#!"

 cuirassier:0 "Curassiers"
 cuirassier_flavor:0 "#F As gunpowder weapons became more reliable and portable, the fully-armored knight on horseback became something of an anachronism, it being difficult to justify the immense cost of full armor and the course of chivalric instruction of a nobleman when he could be ignominiously smitten by a peasant with a matchlock and three days of training.#!"
 tank:0 "Tank"
 tank_flavor:0 "#F Like so many efficient ways of killing the enemy in great numbers, the “tank” was first used to any effect during WW1 and perfected during WW2. It is essentially an armored, self-propelled (on caterpillar-type tracks), self-contained fighting vehicle.\n\nShould we call this 'Tankery'?#!"

 modern_armour_flavor:0 "#F Modern armor is significantly better than those wonderful Panthers, T-34s, Cromwells and Shermans that tore things up during World War II.#!"

 giant_death_robot:0 "Giant Death Robot"
 giant_death_robot_flavor:0 "#F The GDR is not a stealthy weapon, but it is an effective one.

 rocket_artillery:0 "Rocket Artillery"
 rocket_artillery_flavor:0 "#F The Chinese Wu forces were firing off gunpowder-fueled rocket artillery as early as the siege of Yuzhang in 904 AD, although these were more colorful than deadly (save, perhaps, to their crews).
