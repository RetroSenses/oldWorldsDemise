As the ideas of Feudalism and Monarchy crumble, Republicanism and Autocracies have taken their place. Whether it be the Republics of the West, Dictatorships of the East, or Ethnostates of the South, it is up to you to decide which will lead your nation to glory, or make it crumble to dust to be forgotten.\n\n#bold From the Old World's Demise, can you see an Empire Rise?#!"
